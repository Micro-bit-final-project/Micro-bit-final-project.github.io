With the voiceover take from Ciaran, I used some spectral de-noise and multiband compression (with RX7 Izotope tools and FabFilter's Pro-MB) to clean up the voice recording. After today, most of the first section of the video was complete (aside from some final audio mixing, some minor cutting and fade transition shifts and colour grading). I replaced some fixed gameplay clips that contained a spelling error (now fixed in-game) and also created a cool motion transition from a laptop screen to a game recording. 
Now focusing on the second part of the video (being the "development showcase" part), only a few screen recordings of code development/schematic creation sessions with Ciarans voiceover existed, so there was a lot of extra runtime left that was previously dedicated to this section (around 30+ seconds). I have asked Giuseppe to record a sort-of "board review" talking about some of the interesting parts. I plan to cut this content and fit it into the second section soon.

Some more interesting opinions working on this video so far:
I find with my previous experience with Final Cut Pro, I enjoy "stream of consciousness" editing and as this is mostly a creative video project this style and workflow suits the video well. This is why the completion of the video has been very progressive, with the first parts of the video being nearly complete whilst the end of the video was very rough, however the video project is on track to be fully finished by deadline, so this workflow is working well.
