The concept of this minigame is that the user has to blow on a fan attached to a DC motor in order to cool down the engine of a car. The game mechanic is fully implemented, some finishing touches are still missing such as sound effects and animations. At this stage, the game is taking the potentiometer output as an input, instead of the DC motor generated input, for ease of development.
