On this day I spent some time creating a new mini game to add to our collection of mini games. The concept of this game is that the user must chose a path between left or right using the left and right buttons on the controller. Only one path will lead to the exit, success and the other will results in the user losing a life. After finishing the main code and attempting to test it, I came across a problem where I was unable to run the game so, I spent some time looking for the problem with the help of the group and the problem was eventually solved. The finishing touches such as sound is yet to be added.
