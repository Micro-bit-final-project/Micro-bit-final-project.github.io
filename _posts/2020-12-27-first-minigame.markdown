With the barebone menu of the game ready, it was time to start the actual game development. We decided to base our work on the famous Nintendo® game: [WarioWare™][wwre]. We liked the idea of simple short minigames since it would have allowed us to showcase all the functionalities that can be achieved by the Micro:bit hardware. Today the first minigame was introduced: it's called wheelie and it consists of two motorbikes running on an infinite-scrolling background; the player controls the blue bike and has to match the wheelie angle of the red bike using the potentiometer on the controller. The full game mechanic is not yet implemented.
