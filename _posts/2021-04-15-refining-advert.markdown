Today there was some extra work on the first part of the video (the advert), I created some effects including some motion tracked touches that should impress (specifically the hearts/lives clip) and cleaned up the intro a bit more, mixing the audio for the effects and music in preparation for the voiceover, and also cleaned up some intro animations with the "modern to retro" scroll effect. I've also started putting in some other fades and animations throughout the advert.
