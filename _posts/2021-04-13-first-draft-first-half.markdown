Now with some groundwork done for the video and a Resolve project file with some useful assets, I created the first draft timeline. As detailed to the group, there were a few video assets I needed to create a first draft so that (as per the script written by Giuseppe) . The list of footage needed (in order of imporance) was:
1. Close Up recordings of the screen and the controller in shot.
2. Video of the controller in use (including Microbit, LED's, DC Motor fan input, etc.)
3. Game screen recording.

Over Sunday and yesterday, Giuseppe managed to record a lot of very useful content I plan to put in the video, and also a recording of the full build of the controller on the breadboard(s) was provided. This allowed me to make the first part of the first draft (the first minute of two with the advert) which took all of yesterday and some of today to create. The reason for this is that the advert is the very heavily edited part of the video and needs to look good to promote our game. I plan to finish the second part of the first draft of the video after the group can do our voiceover.
