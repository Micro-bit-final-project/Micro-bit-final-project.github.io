The overcook minigame is inspired by the cooking system in the [Monster Hunter franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter). The user has to hold down a button to cook a piece of meat. Once the user thinks the meat has reached the perfect cooking point, a different button has to be pressed to get the meat out of the grill. If the cooking button is not held, the meat stays raw. The user can either overcoock or undercoock the piece of meat: if the meat is way too raw, the user gets 0 point; if the meat is rare or medium rare, the user is awarded with 2 points; if the meat is well done, the user obtains 5 point; and finally, if the meat is burnt, the user does not gain any point.
