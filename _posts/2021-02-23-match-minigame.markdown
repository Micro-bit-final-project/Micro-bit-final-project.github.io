In the match minigame the user is provided with 3 potions. The 3 potions are uniquely identified by a single button press each. The potions are then shuffled and the user has to remeber what button identifies the right potion. The time available to play increases and dicreases based on right and wrong guesses. The minigame needs some adjustments since button presses are sometimes reported erroneously.
