Today, myself and Ciaran spent some time coming up with many different possible game ideas and included a description of each to allow anyone to understand the basic game idea. So, if another group member would like to program it themselves, they will understand the basic concept of the game. The many game ideas have different mechanics and themes, this ensures the player will stay interested in the game and have fun. Many of the game ideas came from just thinking about the simple inputs we have available to us and how this could be used to play the games. Some games have the same input requirements, such as only the left or right buttons. This means that the programming logic will not have to differ drastically from game to game and will reduce the time it takes to make each mini game.
